# Learn Pytorch

In this repository, I am gathering codes and toturials that use Pytorch to implement different neual networks. In addition to learning Torch, I emphasize on learning the Python implementation and using the library itself + mathematics of ML. 

Most of the codes in this Git repository are from the YouTube channel by `Aladdin Persson`. Make sure to visit his channle and see his PyTorch playlist. It is simply wonderful. 

Here is the link to Aladdin's YT channel: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/c/AladdinPersson)

Also codes are descriptive by their names, but here is a brief explaination of each code:

- `01 tensor initialization`: Initializing different tensors and converting them to other data types.
- `02 tensor math comparision`: Addition, subtraction, division, inplace operations, matrix multiplication, broadcasting, clamping, etc.
- `03 tensor indexing`: Advanced indexing
- `04 tensor reshaping`: View, reshape, permute, transpose
- `05 pytorch simple fullynet`: Simple implementation of a fully connected NN: creating a network, seting device, hyperpeter setting, loading data, initializing network, loss and optimizer, train network, getting accuracy and testing model 
- `06 pytorch simple CNN`: Simple implementation of a CNN. 
- `07 NN LSTM GRU`: Simple implementation of a LSTM and a GRU. 
- `08 Bidrection LSTM`: Simple implementation of a BiLSTM.
- `09 Save Load`: Saving and loading a CNN model.
- `10 Transfer Learning`:
